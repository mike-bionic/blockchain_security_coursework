The Internet of Things (IoT) connects people, places, and products, and in so doing, it offers opportunities for value creation and capture. Sophisticated chips, sensors, and actuators are embedded into physical items, each transmitting data to the IoT network. The analytics capabilities of the IoT use this data to convert insights into action, impacting business processes and leading to new ways of working. However, there are still a number of technical and security concerns that remain unaddressed.

Security is a major concern with IoT that has hindered its large-scale deployment. IoT devices often suffer with security vulnerabilities that make them an easy target for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In DDoS attacks, multiple compromised computer systems bombard a target such as a central server with a huge volume of simultaneous data requests, thereby causing a denial of service for users of the targeted system. A number of DDoS attacks in recent years have caused disruption for organisations and individuals. Unsecured IoT devices provide an easy target for cyber-criminals to exploit the weak security protection to hack them into launching DDoS attacks.

Another issue with current IoT networks is that of scalability. As the number of devices connected through an IoT network grows, current centralised systems to authenticate, authorise and connect different nodes in a network will turn into a bottleneck. This would necessitate huge investments into servers that can handle the large amount of information exchange, and the entire network can go down if the server becomes unavailable.

According to Gartner's Forecast, Internet of Things endpoints are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 32 per cent from 2016 through 2021, reaching an installed base of 25.1 billion units. With IoT devices expected to be such an integral part of our daily lives in the coming years, it is imperative that organisations invest in addressing the above security and scalability challenges.

Another breakthrough technology, blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT), has the potential to help address some of the IoT security and scalability challenges. Blockchain is an ‘information game changer’ due to its unique capabilities and benefits. At its core, a blockchain system consists of a distributed digital ledger, shared between participants in the system, that resides on the Internet: transactions or events are validated and recorded in the ledger and cannot subsequently be amended or removed. It provides a way for information to be recorded and shared by a community of users. Within this community, selected members maintain their copy of the ledger and must validate any new transactions collectively through a consensus process before they are accepted on to the ledger. For more detailed information on blockchain technology, please refer to Deloitte’s previous publication The Blockchain (R)evolution.

How can blockchain solve IoT security and scalability challenges?
The IoT network can process data transactions across multiple devices that are owned and administered by different organisations, making it difficult to pinpoint the source of any data leakages in case of an attack by cyber-criminals. Additionally, the IoT generates a vast amount of data, and with multiple stakeholders involved, the ownership of the data is not always clear.

Blockchain can help alleviate the security and scalability concerns associated with IoT in the following ways:

The distributed ledger in a blockchain system is tamper-proof and this removes the need for trust among the involved parties. No single organisation has control over the vast amount of data generated by IoT devices.
Using blockchain to store IoT data would add another layer of security that hackers would need to bypass in order to get access to the network. Blockchain provides a much more robust level of encryption that makes it virtually impossible to overwrite existing data records.
Blockchain provides transparency, by allowing anyone who is authorised to access the network to track the transactions that happened in the past. This can provide a reliable way to identify a specific source of any data leakages and take quick remedial action.
Blockchain can enable fast processing of transactions and coordination among billions of connected devices. As the number of interconnected devices grows, the distributed ledger technology provides a viable solution to support the processing of the large number of transactions.
By providing a way to enable trust among the stakeholders, blockchain can allow IoT companies to reduce their costs by eliminating the processing overheads related to IoT gateways (for e.g. traditional protocol, hardware, or communication overhead costs).
Smart contracts, an agreement between two parties that is stored in the blockchain, can further allow the execution of contractual arrangements among stakeholders based on certain criteria being fulfilled. For example, smart contracts can authorise payments automatically, without any need for human intervention, when the conditions for providing a service have been fulfilled.

Some current blockchain-IoT players and their use cases
The technology behind sensors and smart chips is evolving rapidly, making them increasingly portable and applicable for real-time interactions with blockchain ledgers. The combination of blockchain and IoT has broad potential for the creation of a marketplace of services between devices, and gives companies the opportunity to create value from collected data. The growing number of emerging blockchain protocols, partnerships and IoT device providers already indicates that there is a good fit for blockchain in the IoT sector.

Some current Blockchain-IoT players and their use cases are described briefly below. (Please note that the partnerships and companies mentioned in this article should not be considered as endorsements by Deloitte.)

- Chain of Things (CoT) is a consortium of technologists and leading blockchain companies. It investigates the best possible use cases where a combination of blockchain and IoT can offer significant benefits to industrial, environmental, and humanitarian applications. So far, CoT has built Maru, an integrated blockchain and IoT hardware solution to solve issues with identity, security, and interoperability. There are three developed use cases named Chain of Security, Chain of Solar and Chain of Shipping.

- IOTA is a protocol for fast transaction settlement and data integrity, with a Tangle ledger that eliminates the need for expensive mining (validation of transactions). IOTA is a promising infrastructure for IoT devices that need to process large amounts of micro data. Features of the Tangle ledger, which is the distributed ledger that supports IOTA, are machine-to-machine communication, fee-less micropayments, and quantum resistant data. IOTA has built a sensor data marketplace and is entering the market for data-driven insights, supported by more than 20 global corporations.

- Riddle&Code provides cryptographic tagging solutions for blockchains in smart logistics and supply chain management. Working on the integration between IoT devices and distributed ledger networks, Riddle&Code offers a combined, patented hardware and software solution that enables secure and trusted interaction with machines in the IoT age – by giving machines and any physical device a ‘trusted digital identity’. This technology breaks through the physical/digital divide to strike a balance between the demand for paper documentation and the advantages that blockchain technology has to offer.

- Modum.io combines IoT sensors with blockchain technology, providing data integrity for transactions involving physical products. The modum sensors record environmental conditions, such as temperature, that goods are subject to while in transit. When the goods arrive at the next transit point or end customer, the sensor data is verified against predetermined conditions in a smart contract on the blockchain. The contract validates that the conditions meet all of the requirements set out by the sender, their clients, or a regulator and triggers various actions such as notifications to sender and receiver, payment, or release of goods.

Considerations for the adoption of blockchain and IoT technologies
As explain previously, a fundamental problem with current IoT systems is their security architecture, with a centralised client-server model managed by a central authority which makes it susceptible to a single point of failure. Blockchain addresses this problem by decentralising decision-making to a consensus-based shared network of devices. However, when designing the architecture for IoT devices in conjunction with a blockchain ledger, there are three main challenges to consider:

1. Scalability. One of the crucial difficulties still faced by IoT is one of scale - how to handle the massive amounts of data collected by a large network of sensors and potentially lower transaction processing speeds or latencies. Defining a clear data model beforehand can save time and prevent difficulties when bringing the solution into production.

2. Network privacy and transaction confidentiality. The privacy of transaction history in the shared ledger for a network of IoT devices cannot be easily granted on public blockchains. That is because transaction pattern analysis can be applied to make inferences about the identities of users or devices behind public keys. Organisations should investigate their privacy requirements to see whether hybrid or private blockchains might suit their requirements better.

3. Sensors. The reliability of IoT sensors could potentially be undermined by interfering with the correct measurement of the criteria that need to be met to execute a transaction. Measures to ensure the integrity of IoT devices such that they cannot be altered by external interventions are key to securing a safe environment for data recording and transactions.
In conclusion, blockchain and IoT are both emerging technologies with great potential, but still lacking widespread adoption due to technical and security concerns. Several companies in the market are already working on use cases combining the two technologies, as together they offer a way to minimise the security and accompanying business risks.

The Deloitte Garage Innovation Hub: IoT and Blockchain Showroom
Companies should start considering the implementation of blockchain and IoT to address their business issues, ‘starting small’ by learning from current use cases and projects in the industry. Deloitte Switzerland offers clients an interactive experience in a newly-opened Garage Innovation Hub in Zurich, where they can gain hands-on experience of IoT and blockchain technology, initiate discussions and share ideas on solutions. This innovation space is designed to help organisations define their strategy around IoT and blockchain, and to inspire them to pursue it.

Blockchain is a distributed database technology that provides very hard to tamper, ledger records. It allows storage of all transactions into immutable records and every record distributed across many participant nodes. The security comes from use of strong public-key cryptography, strong cryptographic hash and complete decentralisation.

Blocks are the key concept of the technology. They are small sets of transactions that have taken place within the system. Each new block stores reference of the previous transaction by including a SHA-256 hash of the previous transaction. In this way, it creates a ‘chain‘ of blocks and hence the name. Blocks are computationally difficult to create, and takes multiple specialised processors and significant amounts of time to generate.

Since generating a block is difficult and to tamper one block, one has to tamper the previous block and then has to follow the chain to change it completely, blockchain technology is considered to be tamper resistant.

Miners are the ones who run powerful computers to create blocks.

So, the key strengths of blockchain technology can be summarised as:

It is strongly tamper-resistant
If is highly scalable due to not having any single point of failure and being peer-to-peer network
It can serve as an immutable system of records for all stakeholders
How IoT can leverage blockchain technology
With IoT started getting into the mainstream industry, the key challenges of the technology is fast emerging. One of the key areas of IoT deployment is security. Following are the key security challenges for IoT infrastructure and services:

With the prospect of devices in the infrastructure growing exponentially, it is a huge challenge to identify, authenticate and secure the devices.
A centralised security model will be very difficult and expensive to scale, maintain and manage.
A centralised security infrastructure will introduce a single point of failure and will be an easy target for DDoS attack.
Centralised infrastructure will be difficult to implement in industrial setup where the edge nodes are widespread geographically
Blockchain technology seems to be a viable alternative due to the key strengths described above.

Cases where blockchain can be used
It can be used to create secured mesh network that will allow IoT devices to connect securely and reliably avoiding the threats of device spoofing and impersonation.

Every IoT node can be registered in the blockchain and will have a blockchain id which will uniquely identify a device in the universal namespace. For a device to connect another device, one will use the blockchain id as URL and will use its local blockchain wallet to raise an identity request. The wallet will create a digitally signed request and send to the target device which will use blockchain services to validate the signature using the public key of the sender. In this way, M2M authentication can take place without the need of any centralised arbitrator or service.

For a device that is constrained by a resource can be connected to proxies where the wallet can be stored. This will introduce some form of aggregation but it will be fairly limited.

The above possible solution will be applicable to a wide range of IoT services. Some of the examples will be intelligent healthcare connected vehicles, logistics, transportation etc.

Cases where blockchain is not the best solution
One key benefit of using blockchain technology is its use as a distributed recording system. It allows to securely write immutable records. To do that, it used strong cryptography and replication. For example, in supply change management, a consignment has to go via a series of activities and the status of the piece of an item can be monitored via RFID and recorded using blockchain technology.

However, this comes with its overhead. The replication introduces latency. Getting a block sometimes take longer. Strong cryptographic processes introduce latency. The latencies are not acceptable in a near-time and real-time service situation. Hence, blockchain is not best suited in a recording of raw data at the source.

A slight improvisation may make blockchain adapted to near-time situations. An introduction of aggregation caching node at the closest distance of the sources can be used as a broker between source and blockchain services. However, this will be a deviation from the key strength of blockchain and must be used after careful consideration.

Blockchain technologies can become an excellent ally of the IoT industry. If you want to know how they can help you with safety issues, take note!

When it comes to competitive advantages in a company, the Internet of Things (IoT) turns out to be a very powerful weapon. Each piece of data collected is extremely important to initiate or successfully request an action without human intervention, in which both the privacy and security of the user are compromised.

Considering each technological and physical component of the Internet ecosystem of Things, this technology is understood as if it were a system of systems, with great business value, which needs integrated solutions and protection to complement its functionality.

How to implement Blockchain for IoT Safety
Blockchain technology began to be known with the advent of crypto coins mining since it is its main technology. But now, it also has much to do with the IoT.

The amount of data processed by IoT devices is enormous, all supplied in a chain and exposed to attacks by cybercriminals. It is in this context where the possibility arises to take advantage of the Blockchain architecture to authenticate, standardize and protect the adoption of data handled by the devices.

For IoT safety, the blockchain is able to monitor the information collected by the sensors, without allowing them to be duplicated by any wrong data. Sensors can also transfer data using Blockchain technology, without the need for a trusted third party.

In addition, we must add device autonomy, data integrity, virtual identity and point-to-point communication, all to get rid of technical deficiencies and bottlenecks.

As if that weren’t enough, Blockchain and devices related to the Internet of Things are addressable and are able to list a history of connected equipment, opening a bank so that in the future problems can be solved.

Coordination between devices
As far as IoT is concerned, Blockchain technology stands out thanks to its ability to solve scalability, reliability and privacy issues. It enables coordination between devices, as well as tracking millions of connected devices and processing transactions.

This is a decentralized approach in which cryptographic algorithms are implemented so that customer data enjoy greater privacy. It is an approach that eradicates faults and offers a resilient ecosystem.

The connectivity it provides is unprecedented because the Blockchain is based on an optimal platform, which is efficient considering solutions for the IoT require coordination so that the devices work integrated, without causing problems. It is a secure infrastructure, far from the centralized model.

A trend towards protection
For greater transparency, convenience and security, Identity Management is systems chosen by companies to control access management.

Blockchain Identity is one of those trends, for its ability to store information in chains of transactions that prevent its modification when verified. The structure stores the data equitably, preventing server leaks.

In addition, it is also important to mention Authentication systems, which require the verification of data, as well as the protection of company and staff information, approved by consensus as a right by the General Data Protection Regulations.

Processing transactions
When we speak of transactions, we refer to the actions created by the participants of the system.

Blockchain records these or digital interactions so that they are carried out in a safe, auditable, transparent, efficient and interruption-resistant manner.

Each block registers the operations with a time stamp and verifies that they are in the correct sequence, without manipulations. If someone wants to add a transaction to the chain, everyone in the network validates it through an algorithm; the approved transactions are gathered into a block and distributed to each node in the network.

The new block and successive blocks are validated with a single fingerprint corresponding to the previous block.

There are billions of transactions per device, and adopting a standardized, point-to-point communication model would reduce installation and maintenance costs in huge Big Data centres, as well as the storage of devices that make up the IoT networks, preventing errors in nodes dragged by a collapse or arrest.

So that there is no theft and much less impersonation in each transaction that takes place, it is proposed to use some kind of consensus and validation of peer-to-peer communications, so that the privacy and security of large networks of the IoT persists.

Data Tracking
On the basis of all devices that can communicate with ledgers, entrenched in Blockchain, the devices used in IoT end up being safe in transactions.

The information provided by the customer can be tracked so that the experience is smooth and continues as private and inviolable; furthermore, by using storage and encryption, every part of the chain can rely on the data.

All heavy work falls on technology, through machines, without the need for a human to execute the processes.

The blockchain is an ally for solving scalability and trust issues. The keys will always be private and nobody will be able to overwrite the codes, offering this way the security dreamed in operations of the Internet of the Things.

More advantages of Blockchain on IoT?
It is public, so those who participate can see the blocks, but not the actual content of the transaction, as they are protected by private keys.
It is decentralized and there is enough trust.
Network participants reach a consensus to approve transactions.
The database expands, although records are kept. If someone wanted to modify the previous records, the cost would be very high.
Blockchain Identity is one of the trends in high-capacity technologies such as authentication systems. These aspire to become a law, as they encompass the protection of information that benefits both businesses and individuals, a topic that has been widely discussed.
It allows you to share the use of multiple files.
It guarantees robustness and stability of resources, eliminating the flow of traffic to one and lowering the delay.
The network is secure, the user’s identity will always be private.


Privacy in IoT
Privacy is one of the main unknowns and sensitive issues raised by the IoT. So much so that throughout today’s post we will analyze the control systems and regulations in force for compliance.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming more widespread every day, and this means that consumers need more and better security, which translates into privacy. All this in the face of the vulnerability represented by corporate surveillance and data breaches.

Consumers gradually unwittingly expose their privacy, as they do not know what data is collected and how it is used, for example by mobile applications or apps.
The percentage of people who do not read security policies and accept them without knowing is very high. In fact, there are those who try to read them, but their legal language is in most cases unintelligible to the average consumer, even allowing them to omit clauses that include the right to be heard in court.

IoT Privacy Control
As you know, companies are becoming increasingly crowded with intelligent things and industrial sensors; unfortunately, security will always be difficult.

Most Internet-connected devices are effectively managed by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) which automates IPs. However, the support that gives additional functions is not regular.

Programming codes are a good answer for privacy involving the IoT, and for this, certain service providers such as Chakray have solutions 100% reliable, scalable and modular, which:

Take full advantage of the managed IoT by merging and protecting applications for mobile devices.
Compile advanced analytical IoT solutions.
Digitally connect and manage the assets of any company, regardless of size.
Regulations for IoT Privacy Control
In the specific case of the Internet of Things, privacy in layers is a policy that companies should adopt. They consist of the legal code, what is legible by man and what the machine reads.

The first refers to the actual policy that lawyers write and that judges will interpret; the second is a simple summary for the client to read and understand; while the third is the code read by search engines or software, or understood by technology that would only access the information that the consumer allows.

The implementation of the different layers would be significant progress in safety regulations.


Control systems
Nowadays, to speak of a control system for the security of the IOT is to refer directly to the response that a company must offer when the client claims security.

As a real case that deserves special mention, there is the response of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which developed privacy policies after its customers expressed in a survey their concern for information privacy and the security of connected cars.
At present, a control system corresponds to the self-regulation and practices that the industry implements on data minimization and security since it is their obligation to protect them and if they do not agree to do so, then they should refrain from collecting them.

Privacy by design is another method of the control system, in which manufacturers analyze risks and considerations at the product design stage.

In addition, it is logical that they take into account that privacy goes beyond the useful life of a piece of equipment and the acquisition of a first customer because if IoT devices were resold, the data of the original purchaser should not remain forever in the device.

The general ethical and legal framework of rights and obligations involving the IOT
Yes, more corporate transparency is needed for IoT’s privacy success, and it would be achieved through the rules that the government requires of companies and industrial self-regulation.

The Industrial Internet Consortium, the GSM Association and the IoT Security Foundation, among others, have so far generated some statutes.

These are some of the entities that are dedicated to outlining what would be projected with rights and obligations, as well as security, of the Internet of Things:

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: It has evaluated arbitration clauses and found that they frequently affect the public; and it proposes to prohibit them both in consumer financial products and services, making them valid for the client.
Department of Education: It also prohibits arbitration agreements in for-profit schools, and it approves students’ right to sue schools.
Federal Trade Commission: It works possible agreements -as an obligation- prior to disputes with companies that sell IoT articles. This entity is also asked to take action against deceptive practices if a company does not respect its privacy policies.
Federal Bureau of Investigation: In 2015, the FBI warned of IoT vulnerabilities and since then has been recommending defense and protection steps to customers.
U.S. Congress It introduced the law to improve the cybersecurity of the Internet of Things, so any device sold to the government of this country has no preset passwords, patch forms and other weaknesses. Even if it addresses only the Executive, it establishes the basis for measures taken by manufacturers. Congress also presented the state of Modern Application, Research and Trends of the IoT Law, which will be studied by the Department of Commerce.
General Data Protection Regulations: Formulated by the European Union, it is respected by the manufacturers of IoT devices and networks.

How Blockchain Technology Works

The three fundamental properties of blockchain technology as a data structure ( i.e., distribution, immutability and decentralization, can benefit the Internet of Things (IoT), said Arthur Carvahlo, a blockchain expert and the Dinesh and Ila Paliwal Innovation Chair at the Farmer School of Business at Miami University.

Carvahlo illustrated these properties and how they can benefit the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem by considering surveillance cameras as IoT devices.

Say a burglar is planning a sophisticated act on a high-profile target. To prevent the act from being recorded, the burglar can first attack the server running the database where the videos are stored, he said.

The distributed aspect of blockchain means that data are replicated across several computers. This fact makes the hacking more challenging since there are now several target devices.

The redundancy in storage brought by blockchain technology brings extra security and enhances data access since users in IoT ecosystems can submit to and retrieve their data from different devices, Carvahlo said.

Continuing with this example, say the burglar is captured and claims in court that the recorded video is forged evidence. The immutability nature of blockchain technology means that any change to the stored data can be easily detected. Thus, the burglar’s claim can be verified by looking at attempts to tamper with the data, he said.

However, the decentralization aspect of blockchain technology can be a major issue when storing data from IoT devices, according to Carvahlo.

“Decentralization means that the computers used to store data [in a distributed fashion] might belong to different entities,” he said. “In other words, if not implemented appropriately, there is a risk that users’ sensitive data can now be by default stored by and available to third parties.”


A different possibility when using blockchain in the IoT context is to store access logs and permissions, according to Carvahlo. Specifically, the distributed and decentralization aspects of blockchain make it notoriously expensive to store big data. An alternative is to keep the data in a central repository while storing logs concerning access to the data using blockchain technology, he said.

Thereafter, users have an immutable data structure that can tell who accessed their data and when that happened, he said. Going one step further, blockchain technology can be used to store data access permissions issued by users.

“Any third party requiring access to a user’s data must request it first and such a request and response can be stored in the blockchain,” Carvahlo said. “Now, users and data requesters have an immutable database that can unequivocally determine who has access to specific data and for long that access is valid. This application has a great potential to enhance privacy and even be the backbone of a data marketplace where users can profit from selling their own data.”

The Benefits of Blockchain and IoT

A blockchain’s distributed ledger is tamper-proof, eliminating the need for the involved parties to trust one another, said Andres Ricaurte, senior vice president and global head of payments at an IT services company. As such, no single party has control over the massive amount of data the IoT devices generate. Blockchain encryption makes it virtually impossible for anyone to overwrite existing data records. And using blockchain to store IoT data adds another layer of security to prevent malicious attackers from gaining access to the network.

A primary challenge for IoT players is to protect the information in the entire IoT ecosystem, said Vipul Parekh, senior director with management consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal. Security vulnerabilities make IoT devices an easy target for distributed-denial-of-service attacks, malicious attackers and data breaches.

The integration of IoT and blockchain opens the door for new possibilities that inherently reduce inefficiencies, enhance security and improve transparency for all involved parties while enabling secured machine-to-machine transactions, Parekh said. The coupling of these technologies allows a physical asset to be tracked from the moment raw materials are mined, for example, and among every step of the supply chain until it is with the end consumer.

Parekh noted the following benefits of integrating blockchain and IoT.

Enhanced security. Blockchain technology incorporates security with the ability to verify and allow transactions originated by a trusted party as well as encryption while data is being transmitted and stored. Blockchain technology provides transparency about who has access, who is transacting and a record of all of the interactions. Plus, blockchain adds a security layer in terms of encryption, the removal of single point of failure and the ability to quickly identify the weak link in the entire network.
Reduced costs. By automating the transaction validation and processing steps on blockchain, the entire ecosystem can be made proactive at a reduced cost.
Speed of transactions. This is especially true for supply chain transactions with multiple suppliers, producers, distributors and consumers. With the blockchain serving as a shared ledger to a degree, untrusted parties can exchange data directly with one another, eliminating the manual processes and increasing the speed of transactions.
The challenge for every technology is being clear about the customer problem or need that is being met, said John Rossman, managing partner at consulting firm Rossman Partners, former Amazon executive and author of “The Amazon Way: 14 Leadership Principles Behind the World’s Most Disruptive Company.”

“While at Amazon, we addressed this challenge with a technique called ‘working backwards’ where we started with the customer and worked backwards to the solution,” Rossman said. “Blockchain is an example that suffers from sounding like a transformational technology, but the meaningful adoption beyond cryptocurrencies has not met the hype. In figuring out how blockchain can benefit the Internet of Things, let’s start with the customer and work backwards.”


There are many challenges in IoT deployments, including costs, security, privacy and data exchange. While these are separate issues, there are many dependencies to them, according to Rossman.

“Customers of IoT, oftentimes a collaboration of business partners, need the data and insights from IoT devices quickly, at a performant cost basis, and they must be trustworthy,” he said. “The blockchain can be the backbone ledger helping with all of these.”

Blockchain is encrypted and secure by design with many independent nodes verifying updates to the chain prior to updates to avoid nefarious actions, Rossman said. This is secure by design. The blockchain can be inspected and verified by all parties, helping to improve both access and trust to the data without burdensome and costly bureaucratic layers. This greatly improves access, trust and cost.

Use Cases for Blockchain and IoT

The use cases for blockchain and IoT include the following:

Supply chain/smart contracts IoT and blockchain can be combined for quality assurance in the supply chain, said John Thielens, CTO of Cleo. Perishable goods, such as wine or rare foods, are typically subjected to varying temperatures and light exposures as they pass through transportation and warehousing networks. “By combining IoT and blockchain, the journey of the perishable goods from producer to retailer can be captured,” Thielens said. “Location and temperature data can be collected and incorporated into the blockchain at the case or pallet level, enabling the ability to check the history of the product as it passes through the supply chain and reject accepting the product and moving it forward if the terms of the handling contract have been violated.”
Other than storing data, some blockchain models allow organizations to store and run immutable algorithms in a distributed and decentralized fashion, Carvahlo said. Often called smart contracts, these algorithms enable companies to encode business and domain rules naturally.

Consider a supply chain example where a product requires cold storage, Carvahlo said.

“IoT devices, such as temperature sensors, can continuously monitor the temperature of packages and send data to a running smart contract, which can in real-time inform stakeholders of any temperature drop,” Carvahlo said. “Since the smart contract is running on top of blockchain, the underlying temperature data are stored in an immutable data structure, which helps prevent data tampering.”

Truck leasing. IoT sensors placed in leased trucks can record key events on a blockchain to help manage fleet whereabouts and returns and also to support more meaningful billing practices, according to the Gartner Inc. report “Integrating Blockchain With IoT Strengthens Trust in Multiparty Processes.”
“With IoT sensors on board trucks, truck leasing companies can charge renters’ fees based on the torque of the loads rather than on mileage, which is the current practice,” the report noted. “The blockchain distributed ledger technology supports a shared, single version of truth across participants. No single entity is in control of the data, and the truckers and leasing companies can all independently verify their own copy of the distributed ledger. This blockchain/IoT integration should help the leasing companies increase revenue and cut costs.”

Oil operations and field service. IoT sensors on oil and water wells can enable oil companies to manage the performance of hauling companies that pick up and deliver oil and water from the wells and transport them to various destinations, including environmental waste dumping grounds, according to the Garter report.
“The IoT sensors on the wells help the oil companies schedule truck pickups and allow them to monitor the amount of material picked up and delivered to eliminate fraud and false representations,” the report noted. “[T]he blockchain distributed ledger technology records key events in the logistics chain and supports a shared single version of independently verifiable truth across multiple participants.”

In this use case, implementing blockchain could help the oil companies save money and operate their pickup and delivery operations more efficiently, according to the Gartner report. In addition, by giving regulators a view into the data, such as the amount of water delivered to a water dumping ground as compared to the amount picked up from the water well, the blockchain distributed ledger technology will help the oil company manage its compliance reporting requirements., Gartner noted.

Challenges of Integrating Blockchain Technology With IoT

One of the biggest challenges associated with integrating blockchain and IoT revolves around the constraints associated with the limited battery life of some IoT devices, according to Paul Brody, global innovation leader, blockchain technology at EY.

“Some IoT devices are connected to the power and Wi-Fi all the time, so you don’t really have substantial constraints,” he said. “But a lot of IoT devices aren’t. And you can’t have a compute- and bandwidth-intensive blockchain transaction system going on a very, very small device. So they may need to use some kind of server-based infrastructure or they may need to get help from a gateway device or related device. So these ecosystems by their nature are going to have to be relatively cooperative ecosystems.”

In addition, device security is only as good as the weakest link in the infrastructure, Brody said.

“So if I have a very sophisticated hack-resilient blockchain network, but the operating system that my device runs on is poorly patched or isn’t maintained or isn’t updated, I’ve rendered all of that pointless and my device is easily hacked at the edge,” he said.

Considerations

Blockchain and IoT can be an incredible combination, Parekh said. However, it is essential to note that blockchain and IoT are not evolving at the same pace.

For example, blockchain has such constraints as scalability to handle large amounts of data, regulatory and data privacy issues as well as standardization, which are all pre-requisites for enterprise adoption, according to Parekh. IoT technology also needs to prove that the infrastructure is secure, efficient and resilient. It still must overcome these constraints before new business solutions become staples in enterprise technology.

“In our observations, the client’s willingness to adopt these technologies is not matched by the ability to deliver successful results,” he said. “You need to equip leaders with an authentic understanding of the technologies to make the right decisions and avoid ‘a hammer looking for a nail scenario’ because not every [IoT] use case is made for blockchain. We suggest performing a business feasibility assessment to ascertain the benefits of removing intermediaries, e.g., cost, speed, reliance on market participants in completing transactions as well as the trust needed to share and maintain data integrity among participants.”

Sophisticated chips, sensors, and actuators in cars, industrial robots, or programmable logic controllers (PLCs) transmit data to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) network. Distributed computing resources can use this data to convert insights into action, impacting business processes, and new ways of working. Various technical and security concerns remain unaddressed, but that’s changing.

Security is a significant concern with IoT that has slowed its deployment in critical application areas. Various IoT devices demonstrate security vulnerabilities. They become an easy target for DDoS attacks (Distributed Denial of Service). In this scenario, several compromised computer systems bombard a target–such as a central server–with a vast volume of simultaneous data requests. Following that, legitimate users are denied access to the service.

Another issue is that of scalability. As the number of devices connected through an IoT network grows, current centralized systems to authenticate, authorize, and connect different nodes in a network will turn into a bottleneck. To fix this, huge investments were necessary to deploy servers that can handle the information exchange, and the entire network can go down if the server becomes unavailable.

Another breakthrough technology could potentially address some of the IoT security and scalability challenges: blockchain, which is deemed to be an information game-changer. At its core, a blockchain system consists of a distributed digital ledger, shared between participants in the system, that resides on the internet. Transactions or events are validated and recorded in the ledger and cannot subsequently be amended or removed. It provides a way for information to be registered and shared by a community of users. Within this community, selected members maintain their copy of the ledger and must validate any new transactions collectively through a consensus process before they are accepted on to the ledger.

Built-in Security
A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger used to record transactions across many computers so that any record involved can’t (easily) be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks. This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently. A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. Depending on the use case, people or machines and devices can trigger blockchain transactions. Typically, all participants can access and verify all data, including the full history of a blockchain. In many applications, this eliminates the need for a central trusted authority and trust between the participants. Authentication takes place by mass collaboration that’s in turn powered by collective self-interests. In terms of cryptocurrency, a blockchain confirms that each unit of value is transferred only once, solving double spending.

A blockchain network can be built several ways. They can be public, private, permissioned, or implemented by a consortium.

A public blockchain is one that anyone can join and participate in, such as Bitcoin. Drawbacks might include substantial computational power required, little or no privacy for transactions, and weak security. These are essential considerations for enterprise use cases of Blockchain.
A private blockchain network is a decentralized peer-to-peer network, with the significant difference that it’s governed by one organization. That organization controls who is allowed to participate in the network, execute a consensus protocol, and maintain the shared ledger. Depending on the use case, this can significantly boost trust and confidence between participants. A private blockchain can be run behind a corporate firewall and even be hosted on-premises.
Businesses who set up a private blockchain will generally set up a permissioned blockchain network. It is important to note that public blockchain networks can also be permissioned. This places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network, and only in certain transactions. Participants need to obtain an invitation or permission to join.
Multiple organizations can share the responsibilities of maintaining a blockchain. These pre-selected organizations determine who can submit transactions or access the data. A consortium blockchain is ideal for business when all participants need to be permissioned and have a shared responsibility for the blockchain.
Securing a Network
Blockchain can enable the fast processing of transactions and coordination among billions of connected devices. As the number of interconnected devices grows, the distributed ledger technology provides a viable solution to support a large number of transactions.

As the distributed ledger in a blockchain system is tamper-proof, trust verification is not needed for the most part among the involved parties. Going beyond the authentication issue, blockchain can also store IoT data. This adds another layer of security that hackers would need to bypass if they want to access the network. Blockchain provides a much more robust encryption level that makes it virtually impossible to overwrite existing data records.

Should the network be compromised, blockchain’s built-in transparency provides a reliable way to identify a specific source of data leakages and take remedial action. Anyone who is authorized to access the network can track the transactions that happened in the past.

A few organizations are dedicated to IoT and blockchain. The most famous is IOTA, a protocol for fast transaction settlement and data integrity, with a Tangle ledger that eliminates the need for expensive mining (validation of transactions). IOTA is a promising infrastructure for IoT devices that need to process large amounts of microdata. Features of the Tangle ledger, the distributed ledger that supports IOTA, are machine-to-machine communication, fee-less micropayments, and quantum-resistant data.

Another player is Chain of Things (CoT), a consortium of technologists and blockchain companies. It investigates the best possible use cases where a combination of blockchain and IoT can offer significant benefits to industrial, environmental, and humanitarian applications. So far, CoT has built Maru, an integrated blockchain and IoT hardware solution to solve issues with identity, security, and interoperability. Three developed use cases are available and named Chain of Security, Chain of Solar, and Chain of Shipping.

Riddle&Code provides cryptographic tagging solutions for blockchains in smart logistics and supply chain management. Working on the integration between IoT devices and distributed ledger networks, Riddle&Code offers a combined, patented hardware and software solution that enables secure and trusted interaction with machines in the IoT age–by giving physical devices a trusted digital identity. This technology breaks through the physical/digital divide to balance the demand for paper documentation and the advantages that blockchain technology offers.

Combining IoT sensors with blockchain technology, Modum.io provides data integrity for transactions involving physical products. Modum sensors record environmental conditions, such as temperature, that goods are subject to while in transit. When the goods arrive at the next transit point or end customer, the sensor data is verified against predetermined conditions in a smart contract on the blockchain. The contract validates that the terms meet all of the requirements set out by the sender, their clients, or a regulator and triggers various actions such as notifications to sender and receiver, payment, or release of goods.

Hardware security
The typical entry point for malicious entities is the same as that for goodones: Access credentials are generally regarded as the weakest areas.

The success of a blockchain system hinges on secured user access to the distributed database. If an attacker gains access to another user’s highly confidential credentials, the attacker would have full control over that blockchain account (currency, assets, ID, contracts, etc.). Similarly, if users lose their credentials, they lose access to all blockchain assets and can no longer use or valorize them. Additionally, transactions and operations stored in a blockchain cannot be simply undone. Hardware-based security tokens are one effective way against attacks and unauthorized access.

Storing blockchain user credentials on a computer or a cellphone is extremely risky as an attacker might identify and read confidential information. This could even be done remotely utilizing software attacks. Integrating a dedicated Hardware Security Module (HSM) into the device microcontroller can significantly enhance security. This separates critical operations and credential storage from other software operations and therefore provides robust protection against software attacks.

Convenience is prioritized over security
Connected devices are designed principally for users’ convenience: they enable easy network access, which is usually automatic or by entering user credentials. This allows people to use their devices easily from anywhere in the world. At the same time, this opens numerous doors for cybercriminals, who can access internet-connected devices and steal personal information, such as financial data or sensitive medical information.

Paradoxically, most consumers are aware of these vulnerabilities of IoT devices and yet are willing to sacrifice security for the sake of convenience. Probably the most notable example of this trade-off is smart speakers often used in IoT home automation, such as Amazon Echo and Google Home. Although both companies’ employees admittedly listen to users’ conversations for the purpose of improving the services, this barely impacted the sales figures of these devices.

Security is secondary to profit-making
For example, a couple living in Milwaukee has suffered a privacy-breach incident that reminds a scene from a horror movie. A cybercriminal took over their smart home system, played disturbing music loudly, talked to them via a camera, and changed the room temperature to 32 degrees Celsius. Although this was a relatively harmless act, such incidents are becoming more common and should raise major red flags. At the end of the day, a regular consumer’s privacy is a low-hanging fruit for hackers. Until users’ information is stolen and misused, most consumers seem to be not bothered at all.

From a business perspective, time to market is a critical metric in today’s competitive reality. Unfortunately, ensuring stability and security of the devices comes second. For example, the Global Print Security Landscape report reveals that in 2019 an astounding 60% of businesses in the UK, France, and Germany have been hacked through printers, which led to more than $400,000 in losses.

The centralized IoT network model
Currently, IoT uses a client/server model, or a centralized model of networking. IoT devices use a single gateway to transfer data between them and connect through a cloud server. This model has been utilized over the last decades, but it is no longer suitable for the increasing number of IoT devices and the volumes of data they share. The centralized architecture has a number of shortcomings:

High costs of centralized cloud maintenance and networking equipment. The costs will continue to rise with the proliferation of connected devices.
Low interoperability due to restricted data exchange with other centralized infrastructures.
Single gateway is not trustworthy, as it allows gaining access to a whole IoT network by compromising a single device.
The Mirai incident is one of the examples proving that the centralized model is not reliable. Being the largest DDoS attack ever, Mirai caused a temporary failure of many popular websites, including Amazon, Reddit, CNN, Netflix, the Guardian, Twitter, Spotify, and GitHub. The Mirai botnet first attacked Dyn, a popular DNS provider, and then the internet’s biggest websites through the unprotected network. As a result, the companies lost millions of dollars and their reputation was compromised.

Blockchain IoT security comes in
Blockchain—a decentralized distributed ledger—is a revolutionary technology that could become the key to overcoming IoT security challenges. A blockchain-based approach to IoT networks may solve many of the problems faced with the current model and improve security.

The following features make blockchain an effective weapon in combating IoT cyberthreats.

Decentralization
In a blockchain ledger, data is stored on various nodes all over the world, which eliminates the single point of failure. Before adding any data to the network, all nodes must approve and verify it. Thus, no change is allowed without a common agreement from all of the network participants. This approach is named peer to peer communication and is intended to protect blockchain transactions from malicious parties. Since there is no single server, there is no chance of a man in the middle attack, when hackers can grab the information sent between a server and a device.

Public access
Blockchain is public, which means that it’s accessible to everyone in the network. All network participants can see the common history of stored blocks and transactions, but they need a private key to see the content. This gives a complete transparency to all operations and keeps data safe at the same time. Once a piece of information is stored on a blockchain, it is impossible to change it.

Secure data
Blockchain uses advanced encryption algorithms to secure data, which makes it more private. This is done primarily for financial operations to be carried out without risks. Using the blockchain model, IoT devices may send and receive messages in the same way as financial transactions to enable secure data communication between connected things.


Examples of blockchain mechanisms for IoT security
The application of blockchain in IoT security enables a direct information sharing between connected devices instead of communication via a centralized network, thus decreasing the susceptibility of IoT to cyber-threats. Currently, the highest rate of blockchain adoption among IoT-enabled businesses in the US is seen in pharmaceuticals, transportation and energy sectors, according to a Gartner survey . All these industries rely on transportation of physical goods, and the majority of companies that have successfully adopted blockchain are veterans of the IoT industry.

Perhaps the most promising way of successfully combining the two technologies is to install chips in every IoT device. For example, the alliance of Ubirch, a blockchain-anchoring security specialist, G+D Mobile Security, and IoT carrier 1NCE has developed an IoT security service that leverages the power of blockchain and sensor-embedded chips to significantly increase security. Data no longer travels from sensors to the cloud to be approved, which single-handedly eliminates the possibility of the ‘man in the middle’ type of hacking attacks. Now the information is sealed by a private key directly on the device and is anchored in a public blockchain, which means that data about every access to a particular sensor is forever recorded on a ledger. Adopting smart contracts for this purpose also opens up more opportunities for enhancing enterprise cybersecurity.

Modum.io, a Zurich-based startup, combines IoT with blockchain to help Swiss Post track the temperature of heat-sensitive packages. Temperature-sensitive cargo is a major concern for logistics companies. Modum.io has solved the problem by developing the MODsense T temperature logger, which automatically reports temperature each time the packet is scanned along the journey. Not only it protects customers, but it also allows Swiss Post to gain insight into how exactly temperature-related problems occur. The data about temperature fluctuations is recorded to the blockchain, which ensures that data cannot be manipulated. Watch the video below to see the technology in action.
