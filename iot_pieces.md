Abstract
The deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) results in an enlarged attack surface that requires end-to-end security mitigation. IoT applications range from mission-critical predicaments (e.g., Smart Grid, Intelligent Transportation Systems, video surveillance, e-health) to business-oriented applications (e.g., banking, logistics, insurance, and contract law). There is a need for comprehensive support of security in the IoT, especially for mission-critical applications, but also for the down-stream business applications. A number of security techniques and approaches have been proposed and/or utilized. Blockchain mechanisms (BCMs) play a role in securing many IoT-oriented applications by becoming part of a security mosaic, in the context of a defenses-in-depth/Castle Approach. A blockchain is a database that stores all processed transactions – or data – in chronological order, in a set of computer memories that are tamperproof to adversaries. These transactions are then shared by all participating users. Information is stored and/or published as a public ledger that is infeasible to modify; every user or node in the system retains the same ledger as all other users or nodes in the network. This paper highlights some IoT environments where BCMs play an important role, while at the same time pointing out that BCMs are only part of the IoT Security (IoTSec) solution.

Introduction
There now is considerable interest in the Internet of Things (IoT) as an evolution of data communications that allows direct, persistent, and automated device-to-device communication (also known as Machine-to-Machine [M2M] communication or Cyber-Physical Systems [CPSs] communication). This article is an overview and advocacy paper for the use of Blockchain Mechanisms (BCMs) for certain security requirements in IoT in general and in e-health and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications in particular. The principal applications of blockchains to date have been for financial transactions’ execution, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies. However, new potential applications are emerging.

The IoT application space is significant; Additionally, the overlay of drones and/or virtual reality/augmented reality adds yet another dimension. Up to the present, IoT applications have focused on two broad areas: industrial automation in the context of process control in factories, (Industrial IoT); and sensing applications of all sorts, including power grid administration, traffic monitoring, ITSs, smart cities, video surveillance, body area networks/e-health, and crowdsensing (to list just a few). These two areas deal a lot with the physical aspects of the sensors, the wireless link, and to some degree, with analytics. However, there is a third class of applications that deal less with the physical nature of the sensors themselves and a lot more with the data analytics: these applications address the fundamental transformation of Business Processes (BPs) related to common commercial functions such as banking, insurance, enterprise and organizational operations (including government functions), and healthcare delivery optimization. A new wave of Business Process Reengineering (BPR) is expected to take place as part of the Digital Transformation, and will be orchestrated by advancements in IoT ICT/OT capabilities.

What is the Internet of Things (IoT) and what challenges does it pose?

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that will allow connect an infinite number of devices at all times from any point. Do you know what challenges arise with it?

Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects that exchange data over the Internet using sensors and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

When we say objects we mean machines, vehicles, clothes, appliances and more, with which we live daily, working thanks to a set of technologies that apart from APIs concentrate predictive analytics, Big Data, artificial intelligence (AI), automatic learning, radio frequency identification and the cloud.

It works as long as there are devices with the required hardware to connect to the Internet and a telecommunications infrastructure that supports it.

It is estimated that at least 26 billion units will operate with IoT by 2020, so there are already many cameras, lamps, locks, thermostats, refrigerators and other appliances connected to the network.

The essence of its architecture is to link the real world with the virtual, in addition to helping companies manage the security and connectivity of devices while collecting data from computers, linking them with backend systems, building IoT applications and shielding interoperability.

The data exploited in each intelligent device is used in real time, with predictive analytics and Big Data coming into play; automated learning also delivers context and produces actions without the need for human intervention.

Advantages of IoT
This technology entails new business models and, therefore, new revenue models. IoT brings incredible opportunities for companies to offer real-time sensor data and information services.

It is efficient for automating business and manufacturing processes, as well as remotely controlling operations, conserving resources and optimizing supply chains.

The Internet of Things boosts the productivity and effectiveness of the workforce in many ways because beyond automating routine tasks, it also accelerates the process of decision-making and communications.

With IoT, companies can offer an enhanced experience to customers: in addition to being useful, the products and services related to it have attractive physical and digital characteristics, and they can also be customized.

In what areas is Internet of Things applied?
The impact of IoT is evident in a wide range of businesses. For example, the way products were made changed with the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) along with Machine to Machine (M2M) communication, boosting automation. This technology is capable of preventing or foreseeing failures and even making work safety reliable.

The use of the IoT also has many important applications in the field of transport. Intelligent transport systems for both people and goods use IoT sensors. This includes trains, planes, ships and vehicles. The aim is to increase engine performance, manage the supply chain and handle logistics and security.

Car manufacturing and technology companies use the Internet of Things. How? Intelligent vehicles help drivers anticipate maintenance problems, accidents, find parking spaces, etc.

IoT Safety
As for the safety of IoT, it is based on the technology that protects both the connected equipment and the IoT itself. The “Things” have an unique identifier that automatically passes data over the network; but if they are not protected, they run the risk of being targeted for vulnerabilities.

For this reason, measures have been introduced to ensure the safety of networks and the devices connected to them.

Although there is no single standard, the GSM Association, the Industrial Internet Consortium, IoT Security Foundation and other institutions released frameworks. In addition, in the US, the FBI warned about vulnerabilities and offered protection recommendations; Congress has also pointed out measures that manufacturers must respect, and the Senate passed the IoT Innovation and Growth Development Act.

Also, the General Data Protection Regulation covers privacy in the European Union, which extends to devices that work with IoT; in the state of California, they certified the privacy of information that covers all connected devices sold in the country, with their respective security requirements.

Internet of Things Safety Challenges
While there are many ways to secure IoT devices, it will always be a challenge, especially since some designers and manufacturers focus on selling fast rather than ensuring safety from the start.

The things you need to pay close attention to are:

Passwords that are already encrypted, because even if they are changed frequently, they must be strong enough not resist infiltration.
The availability of security features such as advanced encryption, because it is common that there are some resource constraints.
Providing upgrades or patches, however costly it may be to the manufacturer, is necessary for security.
Legacy assets connectivity, those that were basically not designed for connectivity.
Agreeing on a single framework of protection rather than specific standards, because this would make security less difficult and interoperability more reliable.
Educating customers or users to apply their own methods of precaution, to avoid any breach in security.
Internet of Things IoT Challenges
Many companies have already embraced this technology, which makes their infrastructure more complex.

In the telecommunications sector, the IoT focus is on 5G networks that support the millions of connected devices. The idea is to meet the problem of temporary delays, high speed and low power consumption.

Public institutions such as the government also use IoT to implement numerous services, such as lighting, security, traffic…

The implementation of the Internet of Things leads to a hyper-connected world over which we must have control and in which security is a permanent challenge. For this reason, it relies on programming codes that address such a problem.

Among the technological solutions that favour security, besides supporting the IoT, there is WSO2. If you want to know more about it, at Chakray we will be happy to help you.

10 security problems of the IOT

The Internet of Things (IoT) presents a series of unknowns for users, ranging from privacy to security.

The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) is continuous and there are an increasing number of devices in daily use connected to the network. The same happens in industries, where there is a trend towards the interconnection of autonomous and intelligent factories.

Technology is moving towards hyper-connectivity in platforms, networks, applications and devices, but all of this requires protection measures, proportionate to the intelligence of the devices and their behaviour.

Difficulties with the security of IoT devices
If we were to determine the most obvious weakness in the Internet of Things (IoT), it would most commonly be related to security, not only in consumer devices but also in engineering and manufacturing.

But luckily, there are specialists in the support and development of solutions, such as Chakray. Our team of experts has advanced knowledge and experience of digital security, identity management, access control and much more.

Security problems of the Internet of Things (IOT)
IoT has to think beyond usability and apply sufficient focus on things like:

Software protection.
Implementation of practices against vulnerabilities.
Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of future patches.
We now present the 10 most common security problems of IOT in this domain and their possible solutions:

1.Ecosystem Complexity
Since it should not look like a compendium of stand-alone devices, IoT becomes tangled in its complexity. IoT should to be understood as a rich, broad and diverse ecosystem that integrates people, communications and interfaces.

Although it simplifies life and industrial production, the application of the concept is not simple, as there are many components in its ecosystem. These range from sensors (devices), networks (bridges, routers, WiFi technology, LiFi, etc.) technological standards (protocols: network, communication and data) and regulations (confidentiality and security).

2. Limited capacities in devices
Many IoT devices come with inherent limitations in power, processing and memory.

As a consequence, they are not always managed with the advanced security patterns the need, which is why they are at greater risk of being attacked or succumbing to defects.

That’s why the architecture of the equipment has to be scalable because it’s a way to offer security.

3. Limited experience
As technologies related to the Internet of Things are in many cases still relatively new, we do not have a background of previous threats to let us know about failures in protection. There are not many cybersecurity experts specializing in IoT. A few basic rules are barely available.

4. Threats and attacks
There are computer programs specially designed to attack IoT devices and the ecosystem itself. These are threats called malware. They perform unwanted actions without the user’s consent, causing damage and data theft.

Exploit Sequences are other code-based abuses that take advantage of fragile points to access the system, hitting the infrastructure with a high to severe impact, depending on the assets affected.

Among other threats, we can also mention information modification, message reproduction, network failure, system or device failures, data filtering and device modification.

Often, manufacturers strive to reduce the development and launch cycle of products, prioritising time to market and the volume of sales and without stopping to consider fundamental factors in the design phase, such as access control or encryption of information, among many others…

5. Privacy
When we accept any contract without reading or understanding the clauses it contains, and in truth we all do sometimes, the privacy of our information is at risk.

You are not alone. The number of people who click “accept” without understanding or even reading the terms when using applications or devices to work with the Internet of Things is extremely high.

Manufacturers, eager to stay one step ahead of the competition, do not always apply enough diligence towards auditing their equipment sufficiently, and often do not dedicate sufficient resources to ensure that those who embrace these devices within their lives can be fully confident.

6. Reduced costs
In order to reduce costs, manufacturing companies could limit security investment. The result can be equipment that can never provide adequate protection. The end user would always be at risk.

Reducing costs in hardware as well as in development in this context can be a terrible mistake. The user is the one who ends up paying.

7. Lack of clarity in responsibilities
Regarding safety in IoT devices, there are three key players: manufacturer, service provider and user. In the event of a cyber attack, the assignment of responsibilities is not entirely clear and can lead to conflicts.

Another important aspect is how security would be managed when a component is shared between several parties.

8. Lack of rigour in data processing
At the heart of most security problem’s in IoT is that the user is often unaware of how the data they transmit via sensor devices will be used, because conventional methods of consent are of poor quality, i.e. they do not specify the subsequent handling of personal information.

Such information could reach third parties, and the user will not be aware of this.

9. Safety versus efficiency
The speed with which IoT devices are to be manufactured limits safeguard considerations, and the budget is likely to have an impact, which means the company would emphasize usability rather than security.

10. Limitation of anonymity
It’s linked to a lack of rigour in data processing. Sometimes we assume that anonymity is guaranteed in any service we use, but it really is not.

In IoT, to guarantee this, it is necessary to optimize the techniques of access control, encryption, design privacy, safeguarding the location and any basic aspect to avoid any undesired intervention.
